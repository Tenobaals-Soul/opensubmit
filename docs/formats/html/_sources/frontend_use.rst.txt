Student manual

OpenSubmit distinguishes between the **student frontend**, the **teacher backend** and the **test machines**. This manual only deals with the **student frontend**.

After log-in with one of the offered authentication methods, you are redirected to the *dashboard*. It allows to ...

* ... choose courses to participate in.
* ... see the list of open assignments for these courses.
* ... submit solutions for these assignments, either alone or as group of students.
* ... see the grading / code validation status for your solutions.
* ... see the characteristics of the machines being used for automated validation.
