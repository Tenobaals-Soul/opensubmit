Student manual
==============

OpenSubmit is a small web application for managing course assignments in a teaching environment. It separates between the **student frontend**, the **teacher backend** and the **test machines**. This manual only deals with the **student frontend**.

After log-in with one of the offered authentication methods, you are seeing the *dashboard*. It is  expected to be self-explanatory and allows to:

* ... choose courses to participate in.
* ... see the list of open assignments for these courses.
* ... submit solutions for these assignments, either as single person or as group of students.
* ... see the grading / code validation status for these solutions.
* ... see the characteristics of code evaluation machines.
