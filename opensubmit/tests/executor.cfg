[Execution]

# Place where downloaded archives are extracted, compiled and validated
# The executor will create sub-directories per fetched job
directory=/tmp/

# Script interpreter to be used for the validation scripts
script_runner=python

# Do you allow multiple executor instances at the same time ?
# The answer is always "NO" when the validation is gathering performance numbers
# Please note that this also delays compile jobs
serialize=True
pidfile=/tmp/executor.pid

# Whatver runs under this account is not allowed to run longer than this time
# This is the ultimate safeguard for deadlocks and submission processes going mad
# This also means that you should not use this account for interactive work
